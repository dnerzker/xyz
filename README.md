# a Latter to my self

## Dear Rizki Ardian
``Stop being so hard on your self. Everything will make the sense to you one day. Create a meaningfull life for yourself that you can  be proud of it.
Promise me,
Don't  let the word makes you hard, dont't let the pain make you hate, and don't let the bitterness steal your sweatness.
Never let anyone get in the way of your goals in life.
more importantly, never give up on your passions and your dreams.
and dear,
thankkkk uuu for never giving up, stay strong and being so tough. You know you deserve the world, and the universe loves you.
Happy 23 years old``
