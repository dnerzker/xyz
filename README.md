# a Latter to my self

``Stop being so hard on your self. Everything will make the sense to you one day. Create a meaningfull life for yourself that you can  be proud of it.``
``Promise me,``
``Don't  let the world makes you hard, dont't let the pain make you hate, and don't let the bitterness steal your sweatness.``
``Never let anyone get in the way of your goals in life.``
``more importantly, never give up on your passions and your dreams.``
``and dear,``
``thankkkk uuu for never giving up, stay strong and being so tough. You know you deserve the world, and the universe loves you.``
